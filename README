To post-process a flame, just run:

./postFlame SL_3pt_points.csv fields_to_ignore mops_tst_run Z1 256 1e-3 /home/userspace/ajs224/CFD-MOPS/post-flame/mops_common/850K/in_cg_sg/flamepp_256

or 

(time ./postFlame SL_3pt_points.csv fields_to_ignore mops_tst_run Z1 256 1e-3 /home/userspace/ajs224/CFD-MOPS/post-flame/mops_common/850K/in_cg_sg/flamepp_256) |& mops.log

where "SL_3pt_points.csv" is the paraview generated list of streamlines, "fields_to_ignore" is a list of fields output by paraview which are not required by MOPS, "mops_tst_run" is a directory into which all the track data will be placed, and "Z1" is the flame name.

This will run the simulation with 256 particles and a max_m0 of 1e3.  The directory contains the mops.inx template, all the sweep, chemisty and thermo data and the mops binmary to use.
